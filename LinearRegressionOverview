Supervised Learning notes

Algorithm produces a function f


Linear Regression models take in in input to predict* an output

y^ = prediction/estimate
y = actual true value  



training sets include inputs (features) and outputs (targets)

Key question - how do we represent f

fw,b(x) = wx + b = y^ (y "hat") OR simply f(x) = wx + b
where b = bias
where w = number of observations 

algorithm generates the best fit line based on both the inputs and values of w and b
Linear function is a fancy term for a straight line 
  -sometimes you want to fit data on a curve, a line is a foundation that can help us get to more complicated models
  
  Univariate = one input value
